# E-commerce Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and running the backend and frontend of an e-commerce project using Node.js, MongoDB, and React.

## Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend directory:
```bash
cd ecomern-backend
Start the backend server: node server.js
## Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd ecomern-frontend
npm install
In the project directory, you can run: npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the frontend.

Database Configuration
Ensure MongoDB is running locally. Connect to MongoDB using the following connection string:
Database mongodb: "mongodb://localhost:27017/test"
You can modify this connection string in the backend configuration (server.js or related file) if needed.


You can create a `readme.md` file in the root directory of your project and paste the above Markdown content into it. This `readme.md` file will provide clear and concise instructions for setting up and running your e-commerce project, including backend, frontend, and database configuration details. Adjust the instructions as needed based on your specific project structure and requirements.
